# UET LMS
![Deploy](https://github.com/talhabalaj/uet_lms/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg)  
UET LMS is a cross-platform app for UET's Students to access their LMS on any device fastly. It adds a innovative design with ease of access in mind. 

# NOTE FOR UET IT DEPT
There is no code in this repo that accesses UET LMS. It's a separate submodule that is private. I want the UI part of my work to be open source.
